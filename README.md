# Indexing_And_Searching_Using_pyserini
This repository demonstrates indexing and searching the TREC datasets using Pyserini. 
# The process involves three steps:
1) converting HTML documents to JSONL format;
2)  2) indexing the JSONL data with Lucene;
3) performing BM25 searches.
The project utilizes Python, Pyserini, a compatible JDK, and several Python libraries (BeautifulSoup, tqdm, PyTorch, TorchVision, Transformers). Version compatibility among these components is crucial for successful execution.
